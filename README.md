- - -

# How To Use
You will need to add your own paths to the .my_commands.sh file

create    - makes new repo and adds a readme file

delete    - deletes given repo from github and from local files

goto      - goes to a given repo for easier committing

commit    - commits a given file and asks for a summary (needs to be in correct repo)

For all three commands, you need to give a repo after the command

Ex: `create test`
